                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>QCD was a team based project that was created in a 4th year course, IAT 481: Special Topics. The particular semester offered the special topic: Neurotech. In which focuses on products that "combine digital technology with advanced neuroscience to rehabilitate, change or improve the human brain." (SFU, 2020)
                </p>
                <p>Each team was assigned to research and create a mock scenario with an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of their chosen neurotechnology.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Research & Ideating</h2>
                <p>From our early ideation, research and course material provided on neurotech and neuroscience we came upon ERP therapy for OCD patients and found it to be an interesting and viable subject to ideate a neurotechnology around. As one of our team members have had personal experiences with such therapy.</p>
                <p>Furthermore we found that there wasn't a readily avalible solution that offered the fixes for some of the underlying issues that we noted from our interviews that we conducted in person. Things such as long wait times, shortages of therapists, potential anxiety inducing, and the need for "homework" after each session were some of the common issues and responses that we got. While there are forms of therapy out there such as in person sessions and NOCD which is a video based therapy session. There wasn't any form of ERP therapy in the form of a neurotech that assisted in this treatment, especially ones that were virtual based. The closest thing that we were able to find was Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab, however it wasn't avaliable to the general public. In which QCD was ideated.

                <h2>Product Concept</h2>
                <p>"QCD" was developed as a "fictional/potential" readily avaliable neurotechology that provided a virtual reality experience in partnership with the oculus that would be released to the public via digital copy (downloadable therapy simulations - if the user already owns an oculus) or purchased from their therapists if recommended. Allowing for better accessiblity and an alternative way on performing ERP (Exposure and Response Prevention) therapy that OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) patients might seek or require.</p>
                <p>QCD allows patients to tackle ERP therapy at the comfort of their homes via virtual reality environments, simulations and with the help of a virtual therapist. Providing similar experiences of visiting a real therapist, but getting faster results by reducing wait times on therapists, preventing infrequent therapy sessions and provide a less anxiety inducing experience. QCD hopes to also counteract the need for "homework" after each therapy session.</p>
                <p>Furthermore QCD is meant to benefit therapists as they are able to assist and administer more patients with QCD's helpful log reports. Recording every patient's therapy sessions and seamlessly allows the therapist to monitor their patients digitally.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>While this course was quite interesting and theory based, it was different in it's approach to design. However from this course I was exposed to a unique takeaway of not only learning about neurotechnology and neuroscience. But it was able to teach me how to use my design skills and create a mock startup experience.</p>
