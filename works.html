                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p> "En Garde" is an imaginative ludic designed product created for a 4th year course, IAT 431: Speculative Design. </p>
                <p>Each week in this course, students are placed in assigned teams in which they do sprint ideations and design based on particular guidelines provided, while also applying the theory learned from that week's lecture. Guidelines such as which category to work under from the three choices are rotated each week alongside the group changes: 1. (Data, Privacy, & Security), 2. (Consumption, Production & Waste), 3. (Wealth & Equality).</p>
                <p>In this particular week our class learned about Ludic Design (a design approach that keeps play and playfulness central in it's design and solution). My team was also tasked to design under the broad category of Wealth & Inequality.</p> 
                <p>This particular work called "En Garde", consists of 3 tools/discrete accesories that aim's to explore a potential product that could assist in aiding a women against unwarranted harrassment or abuse and deter and alert other's around when they are confronted with potential danger via it's functional and playful use cases.

                <h2>Product Concept & Renders</h2>
                <p>For this project, my group and I, focused on creating a fictional product that required reworking common accessories that a women would have on them to conceal this tool for emergency use cases. But also be functional and draw from concepts of ludic design's playfulness on it's aesthetic and operation as a tool when needed. After some ideation and consideration we decided that things like keychains and lipsticks would be a common thing that most women may carry around and would be discrete enough to the general public.</p>
                <p>We also found that keychains and lipsticks could also play on the aesthetic and function of ludic design (such as pulling a pin from the keychain or unsheathing a lipstick to deploy each item's intended deterrent effect).</p>

                <h2>Ideated products</h2>
                <p>I came up with 2 out of the 3 products called the "Magical 8 Ball" & "Misfortune Cookie" keychains) and made renderings of all 3 ideated products each going alongside a quirky pun and matching color style guide fitting for its product. This was used as a selling point for it's marketing/advertising strategy. But more importantly to draw attention to this social issue to the general public.</p>

                <h2>Wrapping Up & Finishing Touches</h2>
                <p>The next step once each product was rendered and matched with it's style guide, was to create a design statement.</p>
                <p>As well we added additional punchlines, catchphrases and directions (copy) on each product. These could be seen placed under each rendering (as seen above). Renderings of the product's packaging was also done by my peers in preparation to fully visualize, "sell" and communicate our intentions with this fictional product to our audience. Due to the uniformity of our products and set style guide this step was straight forward.</p>

                <h2>Challenges & Reflection</h2>
                <p>Challenges faced with this particular week's project was coming up with an idea under the broad category of Wealth & Inequality, but also with the inclusion of Ludic Design principles and theory.</p>
                <p>Another challenge we also faced was to design something completely unique from the previous group that have also ideated under the same category of Wealth & Inequality but with a different design theory in place.</p>
                <p>However, by exploring such a broad, niche and bizzare everyday accessory, while polarizing it with a common and provoking issue that we decided upon. It allowed myself and my peers to delve into a field that we all aren't fully familiar with, and by applying the skills that I had with rendering, graphics and my particular group's ability to ideate quirky punchlines, package design and copy on each product. We were understand ludic design theory better and were able to use impactful design concepts in our style to draw attention to our work and it's critique on the category of Wealth & Inequality - specifically pertaining to the inequality towards women.</p>
