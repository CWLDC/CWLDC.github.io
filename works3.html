                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p> At the end of the semester of IAT 334: Interface Design, a 3rd year design course. Students were given the option to take on the bonus project challenge, where students could redesign any pre-existing interface of their choosing for bonus marks.

                <h2>Redesigning - Drugs.com</h2>
                <p>For this bonus project, I decided to redesign Drugs.com. As it was one of the websites that I researched alongside my final semester long project within the domain: health services - and later through multiple stages of ideation and critiques developed Varsity Hub with my team. Which was an application to assist athletes in communicating (their injuries, whereabouts, etc.) and scheduling (ex. appointments and medical checkups) with varsity staff members (medical staff, coaches, etc.).</p>
                <p>I specifically chose Drugs.com as I wanted this bonus project to be a re-exploration of the assigned domain, health services. Furthermore, I wanted to showcase the skills I picked up throughout the semester within the course such as identifying issues with the application through heuristic evaluations, following Nielsen's principles and improving upon them.</p>

                <h2>Style Guide</h2>
                <p>Making the style guide consisted of keeping with the brand's original colour scheme of blue and white. Improvements done were streamlining some of it's current outdated icons with simple distinctive ones and improving the application's overall typography choice.</p>

                <h2>Starting Page and Home Redesign</h2>
                <p>Some of the first major redesigns I made for Drugs.com was to prompt users to create an account or sign in at the start of the application, rather than it being optional that the original implementation has. This was done because the original application locked important app features such as the "My Med List" from user's prior to signing up and due to it being optional, I found that the use case could cause user's frustration and overall felt unintuitive and gave the application a less personal feel. Which this application should definitely consider!</p>
                <p>The homepage was also redesigned to give more focus on the user - via a profile tab that is now prominent. The homepage was also simplified by sectioning some of the original app's features into simple buttons that are sorted with commonality in its feature and use case which the original did not have.

                <p>This final bonus assignment was a great addition on top of all the things I learned in IAT 334 - Interface Design. As it was a simple recap for the course and was a quick way to allow myself to practice and showcase some of the skills learned throughout the semester, alongside display personal design considerations.</p>
