                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>Varsity Hub is a digital application platform developed for a 3rd year interface design course, IAT 334: Interface design. Under the domain - Health Services.
                </p>
                <p>Varsity Hub integrates itself to pre-existing post-secondary institutions via it's digital platform in the form of an application for mobile devices and web use. Streamlining communication, scheduling and academic needs for varsity athletes and it's varsity team staff members (ex. Coaches, Medical Staff, etc.). Varsity athletes and staff can now easily communicate their whereabouts, injuries, make medical appointments and allow coaching staff to access medical reports of their players seamlessly. 
                </p>

                <h3>Research & Early Development</h3>
                <p>From our team's research via surveys with both players and athletic staff members from multiple post-secondary institutions. We were able to understand the target user's goals and frustrations with current management and communication systems. Which frequently occur between a varsity athlete and varsity staff members.</p>
                <p>Over 20 of our participants agreed that current face to face, email or messaging communication methods were convenient and simple. However reported frustrations on frequent reliability, consistency and clarity issues (such as emails or messages not reaching the intended person in time, or miscommunication from face to face communication).

                <h3>Research Process</h3>
                <p>Through our insights derived from our research we developed personas, journey maps and user flows to further understand our intended target user's needs and cognitive patterns during application uses to prevent any negative interactions when designing Varsity Hub.

                <p>Varsity Hub was one of the largest UX/UI projects that I have embarked on in my academic career under the School of Interactive Arts & Technology at Simon Fraser University. It has also been one of the projects that I have become the most proud of, as this project and course allowed me as a student to fully understand the concepts of UI/UX Design. Such as understanding how to empathize with the target audience, and design with functionality in mind to tailor to it's user. It also made myself as a designer, more aware on how visual design choices can alter or impact your design's use case. It is definitely not just for pure aesthetics!
